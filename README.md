### Goal of the project

1. Redesign YG's website with UX and target audience in mind.

### Languages

HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery

### Features

1. User-experience<br>
   Before starting the design, I spent most of the time focusing on who are the main visitors of this website. I observed that most of the visitors sought information about auditions; singers, dancers, producers, people interested in working with YG, not the artists' fans.<br> So instead of arranging the artist content mostly on the main website, I decided to make an easier approach for main visitors so that they can easily get the information they need.

2. Keep the message to visitors simple and straightforward.<br>
   I optimied the menu according to the target audience's needs.
   Under the YG company category, the menu is divided into four menus: introduction, history, business, and investor relations (IR).
   The YG family category is broken into subcategories, artists and actors.
   Lastly, I added a YG audition link for easier access.

- YG Business<br>
  YG actually doesn't have this page on their original website.
  They have a lot of business units and each has all different links and are introduced seperately. Some couldn't be found on their website. That's why some of the units may seem out of place when you think about the YG brand. Therefore I added this menu within the 'YG Company' category. This is catered towards business matters and stakeholders who are interested in YG.<br>

- Artist<br>
  Fans of YG's artists don't visit the website to get news or for communications. Each artist actually has their own communication platform which is run by fans and have much faster updates.
  That's why I decided to display artist information briefly with modal pop ups that include a link with their respective platform logos.

### Self- reflection

Researching website traffic demographics took a long time, especially trying to understand why they visit YG's website. Moreover, there are so many external links that belong to YG but aren't arranged well on their site.<br>
This was one of my earlier websites that I created after learning about basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Therefore it's not that responsive, lacks functions, and doesn't consider browser performance. But I'm glad that this experience has taught me to build great habits of thinking about and focusing on the WHY even though I just made one single button. I need to ask myself why here and why this color. This is very well connected with user-experience.<br>
Thanks to this project, I am also interested in K-pop more than before.
